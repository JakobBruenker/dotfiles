Dotfiles
========

Just your average dotfile repo, I really don't recommend using it for yourself,
it's highly customized for what I personally want.

Installation
------------

If you need to install Arch, [this script](scripts/install-arch.zsh) can help.

First, get the repository, and then, run the setup script:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/JakobBruenker/dotfiles.git
$ cd dotfiles
$ ./setup.sh
```
