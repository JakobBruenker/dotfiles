Dotfiles
========

Just your average dotfile repo, I really don't recommend using it for yourself,
it's highly customized for what I personally want.

Installation
------------

If you need to install Arch, run

```bash
wget https://github.com/JakobBruenker/dotfiles/master/scripts/install-arch.zsh
chmod +x install-arch.zsh
./install-arch.zsh
```

If you already have arch, get the repository, and then run the setup script:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/JakobBruenker/dotfiles.git
$ cd dotfiles
$ scripts/setup.sh
```
